# Introduction Standard Pages  

The Pages PageQR, PageChart, PagePower and PageAlarm follow a fixed configuration, so we decided to implement these in the Admin interface. All settings are made there and stored in the adapter. In the configuration script, only a reference to the page is needed. On the following pages, each page is described with its configuration options.  
- [PageQR](PageQR)  
- [PageChart](PageChart)  
- [PagePower](PagePower)  
- [PageAlarm](PageAlarm)
