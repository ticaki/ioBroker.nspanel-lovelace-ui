## nspanel-lovelace-ui adapter for ioBroker

NsPanel Lovelace UI is a Firmware for the nextion screen inside of NSPanel in the Design of Lovelace UI Design.

### Short Description

The NSPanel Lovelace UI is an alternative user interface for the Sonoff NSPanel, specifically designed for integration with iobroker. It typically relies on Tasmota (firmware) and MQTT (messaging protocol) to provide custom controls and displays directly on the NSPanel's small touchscreen.

### What is the NSPanel?

The Sonoff NSPanel is a smart wall switch with:

- two physical relay switches
- a 3.5-inch touchscreen
- temperature and brightness sensors

It was originally developed for the eWeLink app, but can be integrated much more powerfully with ioBroker using alternative firmware

### What does the "NSPanel Lovelace UI" do?

With this custom UI, you can:

- Display Lovelace-like Cards on the NSPanel
- Display sensor values ​​(e.g., temperature, humidity)
- Control scenes and automations
- Control lights, thermostats, and other devices directly on the screen

## Buzzer Control

The adapter supports buzzer control for NSPanel devices using the Tasmota `Buzzer` command. This enables button sounds, urgent message notifications, and general buzzer control.

### Prerequisites

To use the buzzer functionality, ensure your NSPanel Tasmota firmware has `SetOption111 1` enabled. This uses BuzzerPwm for piezo buzzer frequency output instead of on/off signal.

### Usage Methods

#### 1. State-based Control

Each panel has a buzzer control state: `panels.{panelName}.cmd.buzzer`

```javascript
// Set buzzer command (tone, duration, count, frequency)
setState('nspanel-lovelace-ui.0.panels.Panel1.cmd.buzzer', '1,2,3,0xF54');

// Examples:
setState('nspanel-lovelace-ui.0.panels.Panel1.cmd.buzzer', '1'); // Single beep
setState('nspanel-lovelace-ui.0.panels.Panel1.cmd.buzzer', '1,5'); // Longer beep
setState('nspanel-lovelace-ui.0.panels.Panel1.cmd.buzzer', '2,3,5'); // 5 beeps
```

#### 2. SendTo Interface

```javascript
// Basic buzzer command
sendTo('nspanel-lovelace-ui.0', 'buzzer', {
    panel: 'panelTopic',
    command: '1,2,3,0xF54',
});

// Button feedback sound
sendTo('nspanel-lovelace-ui.0', 'buzzer', {
    panel: 'kitchen_panel',
    command: '1',
});

// Urgent notification
sendTo('nspanel-lovelace-ui.0', 'buzzer', {
    panel: 'living_room',
    command: '3,5,10,0x800', // High-pitched, multiple beeps
});
```

### Buzzer Command Format

The buzzer command follows Tasmota's format: `tone,duration,count,frequency`

- **tone**: 1-4 (tone type)
- **duration**: 1-10 (duration units, ~100ms each)
- **count**: 1-255 (number of beeps)
- **frequency**: 0x100-0xFFFF (piezo frequency in hex)

**Examples:**

- `1` - Single short beep
- `1,5` - Single longer beep
- `2,3,5` - 5 medium beeps with tone 2
- `1,2,3,0xF54` - 3 short beeps with custom frequency
